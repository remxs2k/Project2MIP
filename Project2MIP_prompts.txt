make a game in unity with the following:

- a character in 2D that can move left and right and jump

- collect coins/objects

- avoid obstacles or simple enemies

- have a score

- and have a game over screen


make the physics more realistic, make it such the player uses 9g gravity

make it have a double jump

how do we set the camera follow the Player ?

Debugging prompt: For some reason the player after jumping it underflows by a few px to the ground and the comes back to normal, what causes that and how do I fix it ?

make the camera be relative to the players position

make the game over panel be visible once the players position is less that the ground relative position
